📈 Energy Ladder Modelling for Passenger Road Transport
This repository contains an R-based model that explores how aggregate energy service demand in passenger road transport evolves with economic development and income inequality. The model is grounded in the energy ladder hypothesis, which posits that as societies grow wealthier, their demand for energy services increases and diversifies—shaped by both average income and its distribution.

🌍 Motivation
Understanding how energy service demand scales with income and inequality is essential for:

Forecasting future transport energy needs
Designing equitable and sustainable mobility policies
Evaluating decarbonization pathways in developing and developed contexts
📦 Key Features
📊 Income-stratified demand modelling using macroeconomic and demographic indicators
🧮 Elasticity-based framework for energy service demand
🔄 Scenario analysis for economic growth and inequality trajectories
📉 Visualization tools for interpreting demand evolution across income groups
